second highest salary?

2 ways :
using limit and subquery:
select sal 
from (select sal from employee order by desc limit 2) as table2
order by table2.sal 
asc limit 1

explanation: the subquery finds the salary in desc order for 2 employee , so we got the 1st highest and 2nd highest as well.then we 'reverse the table and pick the 1st one.this can be used for any placed salary.
